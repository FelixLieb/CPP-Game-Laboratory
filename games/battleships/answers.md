## 1) Requirement → Code Map (spec verification)

Fill this table by reading `games/battleships/specification.md` and mapping requirements to code.

Requirement (from specification.md) | Pass/Fail/Unsure | Code location (file + class/function) | Notes (what it does)
---|---|---|---
Example: Turns alternate after each valid shot |  | `battleships_buggy/src/core/Game.cpp` → `Game::AdvanceTurn` | flips current player index
Example: Tracking board records shots |  | `battleships_buggy/src/core/Game.cpp` → `Game::ShootAtOpponent` | updates `Player::tracking`

Add rows for all major requirements you verify.

## 2) Spec verification summary

Write Pass/Fail/Unsure for each area and explain *how you verified it* (test steps or observation).

- Setup phase:
- Placement rules:
- Input commands:
- Shot resolution:
- Tracking board:
- Win condition:

## 4) Code smells found (at least 5)

A “smell” is not necessarily a bug, but a design/implementation choice that increases risk or cost.

### Smell 1
- What (where in code):
- Why risky:
- Better approach (short plan):

### Smell 2
- What (where in code):
- Why risky:
- Better approach (short plan):

### Smell 3
- What (where in code):
- Why risky:
- Better approach (short plan):

### Smell 4
- What (where in code):
- Why risky:
- Better approach (short plan):

### Smell 5
- What (where in code):
- Why risky:
- Better approach (short plan):

## 9) Manual test script (if needed)

If you could not write tests for some behavior, write a reproducible manual test script.

Example format:
1) Start game
2) Place ships for both players with valid placements
3) Player 1 shoots A1 → expect: Miss/Hit/Sunk
4) Player 1 shoots A1 again → expect: AlreadyTried and turn should NOT change
